## Dev memes for README

This action gets a list of dev meme image URLs to a comment block in the README.md, it will replace the image src field with the first url list in the comment block when it runs. When it comes to an empty list in the comment block, this action will get a new one.

Just place an `img` tag with `alt="MEME"` in your README, you can also set the width or height if you want to.
For instance `<img alt="MEME" src="" width="350"/>`.

Because the `![exmaple](https://exampleimage.png)` syntax doesn't have a way to resize the image on github (or there are but I just don't know), so you have to use the `img` tag in your README.md to adjust the image size.

If you want to set the amount of URLs that saved to the comment block, you can set the `fetch_num`. The default is 100.
You can optionally change the commit author and email by setting `commit_author` and `commit_email`. This will default to *github-actions* and *github-actions@github.com*

#### TODO
- [x] ~~Automatically create meme comment block.~~
- [ ] Maybe set the image size from Actions?
- [ ] For diversity, host a meme api server or randomize the list from the api
- [ ] Make the meme comment block optional
